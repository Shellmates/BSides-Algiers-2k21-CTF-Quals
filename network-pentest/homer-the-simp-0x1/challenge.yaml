  HomerTheSimp, that's how we call him, or at least, that's how he likes to
  be called. We didn't bully him or anything, not at all, he chose that
  nickname by himself and he seems proud of it. That's also the handle he goes
  by everywhere—well, by everywhere I mean the platform with the blue bird,
  that's the only platform he uses.
  Before the exam started, you learned that he was setting up a plan in order
  to help his beloved girl to succeed on the exam.
  You heard Homer say: "username is sftp" but you couldn't find out what
  password they were using. It seems that he set up a file sharing service to
  help his girl plagiarize... What a simp! And they seem pretty confident about
  their plan... Time to go naughty, your mission, should you choose to accept it,
  is to get into that simp's computer and his girl's one, and steal whatever
  sensitive information you find.
  This is a three (3) part mission, as a start, do some OSINT on homer and
  try to find some clues. IIRC, he's always been sticking to the same profile
  picture, the one where he faces his computer.
