# APT213 - The hidden part of the iceberg

**`Author:`** [hfz](https://hfz1337.github.io)

## Description

I see that you discovered the C&C server used to instruct the malware, great work so far.  
In normal circumstances—where the server operates in the clear internet—we would ask the hosting provider to make a full copy of the system and shutdown the appliance, but this time we're dealing with a Tor hidden service...  
Try to find a flaw in the web application used to control the bots, maybe you can leak some sensitive information.

## Write-up (todo)
