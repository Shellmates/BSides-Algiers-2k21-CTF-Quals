  Snail Corp got phished (again), but this time it's not that
  kind of usual emails, it's much more. This seems like a
  targeted attack, an advanced persistent threat, and whoever
  is behind this surely got pissed off by their services.
  
  The phishing email was so well crafted that it tricked their
  marketing employee into thinking that the document was highly
  confidential, and contained plans for infrastructure migration
  to provide better internet services–but we know far well that
  this isn't something to expect from Snail Corp, seriously, who
  would believe that?
  
  Unfortunately, the employee–dying of curiosity–downloaded the
  attachment and detonated its malicious behavior, which resulted
  in the compromise of his machine. The employee's device was then
  used to move laterally inside the network and compromise other
  machines to achieve persistence while staying stealthy. This
  happened months ago and it's only recently that IoC's started
  to pop out.
  
  The security team tried to isolate the compromised machines and
  extract the malware sample out of them, but unfortunately, the
  malware deleted itself before they had a chance to extract it
  and didn't leave any evidence. This brought them back to case
  zero, all they have is the phishing email and the attachment.
  
  You are hired to track down the threat actors behind this attack
  and possibly provide a solution for the encrypted files. They
  provided you with the email's screenshot and the attached file.
  
  This is a four (4) part mission, good luck.
