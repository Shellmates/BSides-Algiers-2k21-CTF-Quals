## Description

Good job. Thanks to you we could retrieve the malware sample to determine its behaviour. Your next task is to reverse engineer the malware and uncover its mystery, this should be fairly easy...

PS: The flag for this challenge is the `SHA1` hash of the Command & Control server's hostname wrapped inside the usual flag format, i.e, shellmates{`sha1(hostname)`}.

## Write-up (todo)
