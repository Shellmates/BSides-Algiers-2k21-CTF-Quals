**`Author:`** [hfz](https://hfz1337.github.io)

## Description

HomerTheSimp, that's how we call him, or at least, that's how he likes to
be called. We didn't bully him or anything, not at all, he chose that
nickname by himself and he seems proud of it. That's also the handle he goes
by everywhere—well, by everywhere I mean the platform with the blue bird,
that's the only platform he uses.  
Before the exam started, you learned that he was setting up a plan in order
to help his beloved girl to succeed on the exam.  
You heard Homer say: "username is sftp" but you couldn't find out what
password they were using. It seems that he set up a file sharing service to
help his girl plagiarize... What a simp! And they seem pretty confident about
their plan... Time to go naughty, your mission, should you choose to accept it,
is to get into that simp's computer and his girl's one, and steal whatever
sensitive information you find.  
This is a four (4) part mission, as a start, do some OSINT on homer and
try to find some clues.
