Piracy FTW!

This is part 2 of Keygen Madness, YOU SHOULD ATTEMPT PART 1 FIRST.

Same executable, the goal this time is to develop a keygen for the challenge.

Network service: nc <host> <port>

Note: the network service is protected with a PoW mechanism to prevent abuse,
but that is not part of the challenge, if you're having trouble solving the PoW,
we will be glad to help you on your programming language of choice.
